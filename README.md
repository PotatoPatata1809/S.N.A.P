# SNAP – Student Anti-Proxy Attendance System

SNAP is a web-based attendance system designed to prevent proxy attendance
using dynamic QR codes and location verification.

This project is developed as part of the 6th Semester academic curriculum.

The application is built using modern frontend technologies and will
progressively integrate authentication, QR-based attendance, location
verification, and data visualization.
